 Daily Transaction Analysis and Forecasting

Data Preprocessing
 1 Missing Values: Checked with df.isnull().sum()– none found
 2 Data Type Conversion: Converted Date to datetime format
 3 Feature Engineering: Added Day of Week, Month, and Transaction
 Count
 4 Outlier Removal: Removed extreme values in Amount to ensure
 data quality

 Daily Transaction Analysis and Forecasting
 
Methodology
 1 Data Generation: Created synthetic dataset using Pandas and
 NumPy
 2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed trends by Category,
 Location, and Day of Week
 3 Forecasting: Used Prophet with yearly and weekly seasonality for
 30-day predictions
 4 Evaluation: Measured model performance with Mean Absolute Error
 (MAE)
 5 Visualization: Generated plots for trends and forecasts using
 Matplotlib
